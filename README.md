# LOO - A local guide to accessible bathrooms

## Description

This is an app that finds gender neutral and accessible public restrooms near you. Loo was created using Javascript, Tailwind, jQuery, Google Maps API, and Refuge Restrooms API. Here is a [link to the deployed page](https://safe-haven-bathrooms.github.io/App/).

Some things that we learned while developing Loo:
- This was our first time using the Tailwind framework, and we learned how to access Tailwind without using Node.js
- We created a dynamic Google Maps rendering, and learned about geolocation, referencing other API data, and creating custom map icons
- We were able to utilize a local storage array to save entire blocks of rendered data and append them to a favorites page upon reload
